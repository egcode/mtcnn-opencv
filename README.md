# mtcnn-opencv

No Caffe required on your machine for MTCNN inferencing with this implementation. OpenCV uses DNN module that provides the inference support. <br>

The module is capable of taking models & weights from various popular frameworks such as Caffe, tensorflow, darknet etc. <br>

## Quickstart

### Requirements

* OpenCV 4.1+
* CMake 3.2+


## Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/egcode/mtcnn-opencv.git
cd mtcnn-opencv
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```


## Run

```bash
cd mtcnn-opencv

# Camera Inference example (<app> <path_to_models_dir>):
./build/infer_cam ./models


# Photo Inference examples (<app> <path_to_test_image>):

# An image with 10 human faces
./build/infer_photo ./data/got.jpg 

# An image with 46 human faces
./build/infer_photo ./data/marvel.jpg

```

## Results

Here is an example of how the execution of the sample application looks like
