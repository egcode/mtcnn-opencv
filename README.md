# mtcnn-opencv

No Caffe required on your machine for MTCNN inferencing with this implementation. OpenCV uses DNN module that provides the inference support. <br>

The module is capable of taking models & weights from various popular frameworks such as Caffe, tensorflow, darknet etc. <br>

## Compile / Run

### Requirements

* OpenCV 4.1+
* Boost FileSystem (1.58+)  [only required for the sample application]
* CMake 3.2+

I am using CMake as the build tool. Here are the steps to try the implementation -

```bash
git clone https://github.com/egcode/mtcnn-opencv.git
cd mtcnn-opencv
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

```bash
# running the sample application
cd build

# Camera Inference example 
#./infer_cam <path_to_models_dir>
./infer_cam ../data/models



# Photo Inference examples 
# ./infer_photo <path_to_models_dir> <path_to_test_image>

# An image with 10 human faces
./infer_photo ../data/models ../data/got.jpg 

# An image with 46 human faces
./infer_photo ../data/models ../data/marvel.jpg 


```

## Results

Here is an example of how the execution of the sample application looks like
